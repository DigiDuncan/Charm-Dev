This module provides a Scene class which acts as a sprite list manager.

It allows you to do the following:

* Group sprite lists into a larger object, using them like layers
* Draw & update the contained sprite lists
* Add sprites by name
* Load from tiled map objects
* Control sprite list draw order within the group
