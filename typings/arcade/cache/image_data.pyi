    Simple cache for ImageData objects.

    These are usually cached using the absolute path to the file

    We are not caching by image hash because this defeats the purpose
    of this cache. We want to obtain and image based on a value that
    can be constructed without knowing the pixel data.

    The reasoning for caching the ImageData object instead of the
    PIL.Image object is to avoid re-calculating the hash.
