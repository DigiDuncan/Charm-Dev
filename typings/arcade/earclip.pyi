    """
    Simple earclipping algorithm for a given polygon p.
    polygon is expected to be an array of 2-tuples of the cartesian points of the polygon
    For a polygon with n points it will return n-2 triangles.
    The triangles are returned as an array of 3-tuples where each item in the tuple is a 2-tuple of the cartesian point.
