Hi, Dragon!

(Or Natalie, if you stumble across this!)

Well, the refactor is done, but there's still more to do!

TODO:
- Restructure sustains in engines
- Rethink Hero engine algorithm
- Consider XKey
- Consider the possibility of one parser returning multiple gamemodes (Clone Hero will want this, possibly)
