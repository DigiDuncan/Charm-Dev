Hi, Dragon!

(Or Natalie, if you stumble across this!)

The goal here is to refactor the backend of how songs work to accomplish these goals:

- Song (now ChartSet) is now a generic container for Charts.
- Parsers and Charts are now seperate concepts (Parsers take in a Path and return a list of Charts)
- Split the monolithic gamemodes/ files into seperate modules for charts, displays, engines, highways, and parsers.
- Use as few custom types as possible:
    - No more custom Judgement classes
    - FourKey____ should probably be used instead of specific FNF/SM/Mania specific ones where possible
- All the various NoteTypes should now be specific, like FourKeyNoteType and such

The current code is a mess and I'm trying to untangle it as I go,
especially the typing and making sure expected methods exist on parent classes.

The objects I can think of us needing:

- Parsers: FNFParser, SMParser, ManiaParser, TaikoParser, HeroParser
- Displays: FNFDisplay, FourKeyDisplay, HeroDisplay, TaikoDisplay
- Engines: FNFEngine, SMEngine*, FourKeyEngine/ManiaEngine, HeroEngine**
- Highways: FourKeyHighway, HeroHighway, TaikoHighway
- Charts: FourKeyChart, HeroChart, TaikoChart (and corrosponding XXXNotes and XXXNoteTypes)

* It's possible this doesn't make sense? Like it should be FourKeyEngine and be customizable
but the issue is that SMEngine relies on TimingEngine existing which only exists in SM files
and *that's* due to a quirk of the simfile library that we definitely over-rely on I don't know

** This is currently called HeroEngine but the scoring changes for different gamemodes in Hero
and frankly I don't know what to do about it
Bass and Five Key Keys are the same but Pro Keys, GH Live (6fret), and Drums/Pro Drums aren't and like what do I do about that
We don't even support those yet so maybe it doesn't matter

TODO:
- Move HeroParser, HeroChart
- Move HeroHighway, HeroDisplay
- Move HeroEngine
- Move FNFDisplay
- Move TaikoHighway, TaikoDisplay

- Restructure sustains in engines
- Rethink Hero engine algorithm
- Consider XKey
